# AI Model Cost and Performance Dashboard

🚀 **Welcome to the AI Model Cost and Performance Dashboard!** 🚀  

This project is a **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze and visualize the cost, efficiency, and performance of various AI models. It helps businesses and data enthusiasts make data-driven decisions by providing insights into input/output costs, speed, and token usage across models like GPT-4, Claude 2.1, and Gemini Pro.
